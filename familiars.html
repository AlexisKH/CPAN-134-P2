                <div class="description-container">
                    <p> Animal Familiars are loyal beast assistants and guardians who can accompany Melinoë during a night, providing various utilities both in and out of battle. She can bring one Familiar per night. </p>
                    <p> The familiars can attack, give a bonus in one of Melinoë base stats, increase the chances of a specific resource of appearing and have an extra passive to support Melinoë. <p>
                    <p> To recruit them as Familiars, Melinoë must give them a Witch's Delight, which is unlocked after completing the Incantation "Faith of Familiar Spirits". </p>
                    <p> To strengthen her bond and unlock the full potential of her Familiars, Melinoë must have at least three Animal Familiars and complete the Incantation "Attending a Faithful Beast" and "Bravery of Familiar Spirits", and offer each Familiar up to 9 Witch's Delight to fully develop their abilities. </p>
                </div>

                        <h3> Frinos </h3>
                        <p> When Frinos is equipped, he leaps randomly about the encounter arena and absorbs projectiles, 
                            ostensibly serving as portable cover. He cannot be stunned or take damage, 
                            though he is typically knocked back when he takes a hit. Some types of projectiles, 
                            most notably wave-shaped ones, can pass through him, however. <br> <br>
                            He also has the tool function of the Tablet of Peace; 
                            he increases the chances of Lost Shades to appear during a run and can turn them directly into Psyche, 
                            skipping the minigame.

                        <h3> Toula </h3>
                        <p> When Toula is equipped, she rests somewhere in the encounter arena until Melinoe sprints past her, 
                            which wakes her. Toula will then deal 99 damage to a nearby foe and cannot be used again until 
                            she returns to a resting position. She also provides the player with an additional Death Defiance. <br> <br>
                            She has a gathering tool function, allowing the player to catch fish without the Fishing Rod, 
                            skipping the minigame entirely.

                        <h3> Raki </h3>
                        <p> When Raki is equipped, he occasionally swoops down to peck foes and applies Marked (30% crit chance). 
                            While together, gain an additional percentage chance for any damage dealt to be Critical.  <br> <br>
                            Raki assists Melinoë in mining Outcroppings and increasing the chances of their appearance, allowing for 
                            collection with a single click.

                        <h3> Hecuba </h3>
                        <p> When Hecuba is equipped, she will sometimes dig up spots in the ground to unearth resources such as healing or 
                            magick. Hecuba assists Melinoë by helping to acquire seeds and increasing the likelihood of Digging Spots appearing. 
                            Additionally, Hecuba boosts Melinoë’s Max Magick, and provides a chance to unearth Magick bubbles during 
                            encounters and Health along with seeds. <br> <br>
                            Like other Familiars, Hecuba possesses a tool function. She replaces the Silver Spade.

                        <p> Gale assists Melinoë by helping to acquire flora and increasing their likelihood of appearing. 
                            She also enhances Melinoë's dodge chance and movement speed, while granting the ability to leap onto enemies, 
                            blocking damage for a set time in each region. <br><br>
                            When collecting flora, Gale has a chance of double resource collection.
